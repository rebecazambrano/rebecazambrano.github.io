# Reticulate

The reticulate package in R allows users to use both python and R. It allows these languages to interact. This package is useful to combine the strengths of each language. It allows the user to keep everything in one file and allows it to flow better.

##Python and R in Action

Python and R can work together to modify and combine strings. 

```{R}
library(reticulate)

phrase<- "African elephants are the world's largest land animal!"
phrase2<- "Elephants have about 150,000 muscle units in their trunk."
phrase3<- "Elephants need about 150 kg of food everyday!"
```


```{python}
facts="Fun fact:"
print(facts,r.phrase)
print(facts,r.phrase2)
print(facts,r.phrase3)
```

You can also use regular expressions to extract information from text by searching for matches of a given pattern. The string is from a R chunk while the matches are found in a python chunk. 

The following example shows the use of regular expression in python to extract IP addresses from a string in R.
```{R}
string2="Jan 13 00:48:59: DROP service 68->67(udp) from 213.92.153.167 to 69.43.107.219, prefix: \"spoof iana-0/8\" \
(in: eth0 69.43.112.233(38:f8:b7:90:45:92):68 -> 217.70.100.113(00:21:87:79:9c:d9):67 UDP len:576 ttl:64) \
Jan 13 12:02:48: ACCEPT service dns from 74.125.186.208 to firewall(pub-nic-dns), prefix: \"none\" \
(in: eth0 74.125.186.208(00:1a:e3:52:5d:8e):36008 -> 140.105.63.158(00:1a:9a:86:2e:62):53 UDP len:82 ttl:38) \
Jan 13 17:44:52: DROP service 68->67(udp) from 172.45.240.237 to 217.70.177.60, prefix: \"spoof iana-0/8\" \
(in: eth0 216.34.90.16(00:21:91:fe:a2:6f):68 -> 69.43.85.253(00:07:e1:7c:53:db):67 UDP len:328 ttl:64) \
Jan 13 17:52:08: ACCEPT service http from 213.121.184.130 to firewall(pub-nic), prefix: \"none\" \
(in: eth0 213.121.184.130(00:05:2e:6a:a4:14):8504 -> 140.105.63.164(00:60:11:92:ed:1b):80 TCP flags: ****S* len:52 ttl:109)"
```

```{python}
import re
re.findall(r"\d+[.]\d+[.]\d+[.]\d+",r.string2) 
```

The following example shows the use of regular expression in python to extract urls from a string in R.
```{R}

```{python}
re.findall(r"http\S+\b",r.string4)
```

You can also work with data between R and python. 

This is an R chunk:
```{R}
quakes<-quakes
```

While this is a python chunk:
```{python}
r.quakes.mag.mean()
r.quakes.depth.mean()
r.quakes.mag.median()
r.quakes.depth.median()
r.quakes.mag.std()
r.quakes.depth.std()
```
